'Marvel''s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the second game in the PlayStation exclusive Marvel''s Spider-Man series, following Marvel''s Spider-Man (2018). It is centered around Miles Morales, a fictional comic book superhero who becomes Spider-Man as a Black teenager of Puerto Rican ancestry on his mother''s side, following the death of Peter Parker.

Miles trains under Parker and is still integrating in the role of a Spider-Man. In the game Parker does not die, but leaves to join his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson to cover a civil war, leaving Miles as the only webslinger in New York.',
